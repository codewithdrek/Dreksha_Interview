     early binding and late binding
     Internally working of Concurrent hashMap: lock over segment

     FINAL CONST : No, a constructor can't be made final. A final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses.CONST CAN BE PRIVATE
    
    
    Early Binding	Late Binding  : 
  EARLY:  The binding which can be resolved at compile time by the compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time. 
It is a compile-time process	It is a run-time process
The method definition and method call are linked during the compile time.	The method definition and method call are linked during the run time.
Actual object is not used for binding.	Actual object is used for binding.
For example: Method overloading	For example: Method overriding
Program execution is faster	Program execution is slower

Late binding: In the late binding or dynamic binding, the compiler doesnâ€™t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding. In overriding both parent and child classes have the same method
